# Build-RAG-pipelines-using-Llama-Index

This repository contains the code and data for building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the **Llama Index**. RAG is a neural text generation model that leverages a large-scale knowledge source to produce informative and diverse outputs. Llama Index is a fast and scalable approximate nearest neighbor search engine that can be used to retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher
- Transformers 4.5 or higher
- Faiss 1.7 or higher
- Llama 0.1 or higher

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the RAG pipeline using the Llama Index, follow these steps:

1. Run the `Llama-Index_RAG_Pipelines_.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` folder. This notebook will guide you through the process of creating a Llama Index, loading a pre-trained RAG model, and generating text using the index and the model.
2. Enjoy the results and experiment with different queries and parameters.
